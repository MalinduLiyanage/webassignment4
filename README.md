*******Changelog*********
In this assignment, I have added MySQL Database functionality with PHP support to the webpage created for Assignment 03 (https://malinduliyanage.github.io/) source files. (https://github.com/MalinduLiyanage/MalinduLiyanage.github.io)
I prefer both online and local hosting methods. So this Readme file will guide you through how things are going to be operated.

*******See Live Demo/Online hosted option*********
To see how the webpage works with this DB, please goto https://whiplike-pistol.000webhostapp.com/

*******How to implement the webpage with DB/local host option*********
1. I have used XAMPP for this purpose, you may get it through https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2. Install and setup XAMPP, and turn on Apache server + MySQL server.
3. Download this repo as a .zip file and extract them to C:\xampp\htdocs\5005 (Create the dir '5005') 
4. Copy those files to this EXACT LOCATION. ELSE IT WILL NOT BE OPERATED. Like in : https://imgur.com/a/P6W7PIg
5. Then goto phpMyadmin and import the database file that exists in db folder as shown in https://imgur.com/a/rfwPaAk
6. Now it is good to go. This website is now hosted via http://localhost/5005
7. Goto Shopping tab to login to account to operate functions like Add Cart, Contact msgs vice versa.
8. Website will give you further instructions.
